## How it Works ?
The proposed app aims to provide a comprehensive solution for individuals facing lifestyle diseases like diabetes and blood pressure. It will serve as a one-stop-shop for individuals looking to stay informed about diseases and find the best possible medical assistance. The app will have several key features to serve this purpose:

Disease prediction - Using advanced algorithms, the app will predict potential diseases that the user might be at risk of, based on their symptoms and other risk factors.
Awareness feed - Our partners, such as hospitals and doctors, can post valuable information, news, and warnings about diseases in the user's local area.
Personalized recommendations - Based on usersâ€™ symptoms, risk factors, and previous reports, the app will offer personalized health recommendations.
Doctor and hospital search - The app will allow users to search for the best doctor and hospital for their specific needs based on their location, reputation, and services offered.
Map integration - A map will be integrated into the app, which will allow users to easily locate hospitals and doctors near their location.
The app will be developed using Flutter, with the help of Location and Map packages.

The overall aim of the app is to improve the health and well-being of individuals by providing them with relevant and up-to-date information, and by connecting them with the best medical assistance available.
